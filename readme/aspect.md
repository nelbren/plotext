## Plot Labels

You could easily add the following text labels to the plot:

- a **title** on the top of the active plot with `plt.title()`.

- the **x axes labels** with `plt.xlabel()`: its parameter `xside` is used to address a specific `x` axis , `"lower"` or `"upper"` (in short `1` or `2`).

- Analogously the **y axes labels** with `plt.ylabel()`: `yside` parameter, is used to address a specific `y` axis , `"left"` or `"right"` (in short `1` or `2`).

- The axes labels will all appear at the bottom of the plot, with the exception of the upper `x` axis label, which will appear on the top center of the plot, moving the plot title to the top left, if present.

- To change the labels colors and styles, use the functions `ticks_colors()` and `ticks_style()`, as explained in [this section](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext/blob/master/readme/aspect.md#colors).

## Plot Lines

Here are the main functions used to alter the plot lines:

- `plt.xaxes()` to set whatever or not to show the `x` axes; it accepts two Boolean inputs, one for each `x` axis (`lower` and `upper`).

- `plt.yaxes()` to set whatever or not to show the `y` axes; it accepts two Boolean inputs, one for each `y` axis (`left` and `right`).
 
- To control all axes simultaneously, use the function `plt.frame()` instead, which will show or remove the plot frame (composed of all 4 axes). It require a single Boolean.

- The function `plt.grid()` is used to add or remove the horizontal and vertical grid lines and requires two Boolean inputs.

- To add extra lines at some specific coordinates use the functions `vertical_line()` and `horizontal_line()` ad explained in [this section](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext/blob/master/readme/tools.md#extra-lines).

## Colors

Colors could easily applied to the entire plot, using the following functions:

- `canvas_color()` to set the background color of the plot canvas alone (the area where the data is plotted).

- `axes_color()` to sets the background color of the axes, axes numerical ticks, axes labels and plot title.

- `ticks_color()` sets the (fullground) color of the axes ticks, the grid lines, title, and legend labels, if present.

- `ticks_style()` sets the style of the axes ticks, title, and legend labels, if present.

To quickly set all those values at once use the function `theme()`. To check the available themes use the function `themes()`; here is its output: 

![themes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piccolomo/plotext/master/images/themes.png)

Note: to add, tweak, rename any theme presented, please feel free to open an issue, dropping your favourite combination of canvas, axes, ticks color and style together with 3 signal colors in sequence: any idea is welcomed. 

To remove all plot colors and styles from the current subplot, use `clear_color()` - in short `clc()`, which is equivalent to `theme('clear')`.

If instead you want to set the colors manually, here are the types of color codes that could be provided as input for the functions `canvas_color()`, `axes_color()` and `ticks_color()` or to the `color` parameter of any plotting function, as well as the `fullground` or `background` parameter of the function `plt.colorize()`:

- The following **color string codes**: 

  ![color-codes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piccolomo/plotext/master/images/color-codes.png)

  `default` will use the default terminal color.

- An **integer between 0 and 255**, resulting in the following colors:

  ![integer-codes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piccolomo/plotext/master/images/integer-codes.png)

  Note: the first 16 produce the same results as the previous string color codes.

- An **RGB color** consisting of a tuple of three values (red, green, blue), each between 0 and 255, to obtain the most realistic color rendering.

- A **list of color codes** to give a different color to each plot marker: the length of the list of colors will adapt to the length of the data set. Each color could be of a different kind (string, integer or rgb).

- Access the function `colors()` for the available string and integer codes.


Finally these are the available **style codes** that could be provided as input to the function ticks_style() or to the `style` parameter of any plotting function, including `colorize()`:

![style-codes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piccolomo/plotext/master/images/style-codes.png)

- any number of styles could be used at the same time, provided they are separated by a space. 

- using `flash` will result in an actual white flashing marker.

## Markers

To specify which marker to use, use the parameter `marker`, available for most plotting functions, eg: `plt.scatter(data, marker = "x")`. You could provide the following:

- A **single character**: if the space character, the plot will be invisible. 

- A **list of specific markers**, one for each data point: its length will automatically adapt to the data set.

- One of the following **marker codes** which will translate in the marker specified (some may not be available in Windows): 

  ![markers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piccolomo/plotext/master/images/markers.png)

- The marker code `sd` stands for "standard resolution".

- **`hd`** stands for *high resolution*, which uses 2 x 2 unicode block characters, such as â–ž. 

- **`fhd`** stands for *full high resolution*, which uses 3 x 2 unicode block characters, such as ðŸ¬—.  This marker works only in Unix systems and only in some terminals.

- Access the function `markers()` for the available marker codes.
